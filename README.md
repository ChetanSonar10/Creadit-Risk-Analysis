# Creadit-Risk-Analysis

NOTE: This project has been conducted as per Capital Adequacy, Regulations, and the Basel 2 Accord. The intention is to serve the best to everyone, from leaders to borrowers.

The scope of this is to dive deep into various features of the data to explore the opportunities to help the financial institutions as well as the borrowers, after all the balance is important.

The Credit Risk Analysis Project repository! This project is an in-depth exploration of credit risk assessment using machine learning techniques. Credit risk analysis plays a crucial role in financial institutions, helping them make informed decisions on extending credit to individuals and businesses.

1. Exposure at Default (EAD):
Exposure at Default (EAD) is a critical metric used in credit risk analysis to quantify the potential financial exposure a lender faces if a borrower defaults on their obligation. It represents the total outstanding exposure or the amount at risk when a default event occurs. EAD takes into account the current exposure and any possible changes in exposure that may occur before or at the time of default.

2. Probability of Default (PD):
Probability of Default (PD) is a key credit risk parameter that measures the likelihood or probability that a borrower will default on their debt obligations within a specified period. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is crucial for assessing credit risk and determining appropriate risk premiums or interest rates.

3. Loss Given Default (LGD):
Loss Given Default (LGD) is a metric that quantifies the expected loss a lender is likely to incur in the event of borrower default. It represents the percentage of the exposure that cannot be recovered after a default. LGD takes into account the value of the collateral (if any) and the recovery process for the lender.
